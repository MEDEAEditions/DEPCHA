    <dc:description>The collection of inventories produced by an office of the Florentine state, called the Magistrati dei Pupilli. This office created in the late 14th century at the request of Florentine families. Due primarily to recurrent plague in Florence starting in mid-14th century families were unable to manage the wealthy estates of their minor relatives, who had inherited considerable assets upon the death of their benefactors. Families asked the state to take over. When the Office of Orphans took on the management of a minor’s estate, a packet of documents was created to record actions taken on the minor’s behalf.</dc:description>
