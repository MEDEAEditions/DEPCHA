1# wrong clsoing tag </name>:
line 66:

2# TEI sourceDesc
line 65: 
you can either have a <p> in <sourceDesc> or a more complexe description using <msDesc> etc. 

3# TEI @quantity contains a string, just numbers are allowed
line 1000:  <measure commodity="currency" quantity="Stagville" unit="pence">

4# "1/2" "3/4" in @quantity; normalization 0.5 and 0.75 is needed.
line:1167  <measure commodity="coffee" quantity="1/2" unit="lb">

5# "-" in @quantity; i think this are all cases in that a precceding <measure> not containing '-' and with the same @unit  contains the correct value: Xpath: ./preceding::t:measure[@unit = $currentUnit][not(text() = '-')][1]/@quantity"/>
line:1105   <measure commodity="coffee" quantity="1/2" unit="lb">

6# @when is not allowed in <cell>: better is  <cell><date ana="#bk_when" when="1808-08-01"/></cell>
line:1117 <cell ana="#bk_when"  when="1808-08-01">1</cell>

7# <head> is not everywhere allowed in TEI; replacing the <p> with a <div> would work
line:1253 
<div>

 <lb/>
</div>

8# bk_what is not supported in the GAMS TORDF, replacing it with bk_commodity

9# bk_amount is not supported in the GAMS TORDF, replacing it with bk_money

10# putting bk_amount (bk_money), bk_what (bk_commodity) directly into the @ana in <measure> 
<cell ana="#bk_what">
  <measure commodity="powder" quantity="1/2" unit="lb">
    1/2 lb
    <rs ref="#S10756">Powder</rs>5/-
  </measure>
</cell>

becomes

<cell>
  <measure ana="#bk_commodit" commodity="powder" quantity="0.5" unit="lb">
    1/2 lb <rs ref="#S10756">Powder</rs> 5/-
  </measure>
</cell>

11# there is a bk_from too much
line:2062
<head ana="#bk_party #bk_from" depth="2">
  69
  <rs ana="#bk_party #bk_from #bk_agent" ref="#S14357">Mark Veazey</rs> PP Bro
  <rs  ana="#bk_party #bk_from #bk_account"ref="#S14358">Bro William</rs> Dr.
</head>

i think the best way would be: 

<head>
  69
  <name ana="#bk_party #bk_from #bk_agent" ref="#S14357">Mark Veazey</rs> PP Bro
  <name  ana="#bk_party #bk_from" ref="#S14358">Bro William</rs> Dr.
</head>

12# @quantity and @unit: and the @ref for the Shot should be in the @unit i think
line:2104
<measure commodity="shot" quantity="&amp;amp" unit=";">
  &amp;amp ;
  <rs ref="#S10757">Shot</rs>5/-
</measure>
