Here are 3 different pages from Ledger A ([27](http://financial.gwpapers.org/?q=content/ledger-1750-1772-pg27), [28](http://financial.gwpapers.org/?q=content/ledger-1750-1772-pg28), [42](http://financial.gwpapers.org/?q=content/ledger-1750-1772-pg42)). Included is the original export from the site for both the page overviews and the associated transactions. Because the original export only allows for a minuscule hierarchy, a bit of xslt was done in order to get it closer to some of the other exports. For the individual transactions, the currency data wasn't applied consistently due to time but it has been included to show some of the variants we come across. The page overview is where we list the agricultural terms, food and beverage, places, and people mentioned on the page. I wasn't sure how to reverse concatenate the lists. However, they are consistently separated by semicolons (a different delimiter will be chosen in future exports since some place names do contain semicolons).
