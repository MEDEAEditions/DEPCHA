# Notes

* all bk:Entry with the string "[Total]" are bk:Sum; they don't have a bk:when
* Q: are there normalized dates (bk:when) in the GWFP-export?
* Q: there are empty rows in the csv. do they have a meaning?
* 1 Pound = 20 Shilling = 240 pence (?)  --> than pence are more or less irrelevant? like 19pence are 0.03 pound? (if you do rounding; infovis)
